# EduHub - A Platform for Curated Educational Content

EduHub is an innovative platform designed to centralize and deliver high-quality educational content, addressing the growing need for reliable learning resources in an age where educational content is often scattered and diluted by irrelevant material. Unlike popular platforms such as YouTube, EduHub exclusively hosts educational content, ensuring that students and educators have access to distraction-free, focused learning materials.

EduHub is built with the core mission of supporting students, teachers, and educational institutions by offering a space where only verified educators and authorized content creators can upload learning resources
